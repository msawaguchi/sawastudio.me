        'I started getting interested in computing at the age of 11, during my first encounter with a PC. Initially, my focus was more on hardware, but that changed when I took a technical course in computer science in 2012. There, I learned programming logic, databases, web, and desktop programming. My interest in programming grew, leading me to enroll in a Computer Science degree program in 2015, and I began working professionally in my first internship in 2016. I am deeply grateful for working with something I worship.',
